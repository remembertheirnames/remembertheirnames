            <h5>The Opioid Epidemic, Sackler, and Harvard</h5>
            why we hold responsibility
            <br><br>
            <p class="actions">
                In this context, the name Sackler is best known as that of the 
                family that built Purdue Pharma and developed OxyContin. 
                <br><br>
                At Harvard, however, Sackler carries vastly different implications. A huge portion
                of our Asian art collection comes directly from their family, and various 
                other buildings and rooms also display the family name as a result of accepting a 
                vast sum of donations. 
                <br><br>
                Tied together by an extensive history of benefaction and legal documents, Harvard
                now finds it impossible to shed itself of this name and its associations. Regardless of
                what we can do to alter the past, however, we recognize the necessity of acknowledging all perspectives and 
                experiences of this complicated, devastating issue, listening to additional voices, and through 
                this modifying our practices going forward to permanently prevent the reoccurrence of 
                anything similar. 
                <br><br>
                The Arthur M. Sackler Building and Harvard are public-facing institutions with an 
                educational mission. They teach people how to be civically engaged scholars who 
                practice the responsible telling of history, which includes acknowledging and 
                validating all perspectives of a complex issue. We aspire to do the same and to
                prompt other museums and educational institutions to reexamine how their funding 
                practices can better represent the interests of the communities and the public that they serve.
